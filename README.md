### Hello there üëã


My name is Leandro Sim√µes, but you can call me **Le**. I'm Software Developer from Brazil, Assistant Professor and hold a master's degree in Computer Science from UFJF.

I've been working with **Node**, **Typescript**, **React**, **AWS**, but I have interests in other languages like **Rust** or **Vala** (and someday I would like to contributing with Pop Os or Elementary OS - maybe would be my next project). 

#### Some facts about me:

- I've been working remotely for the last 4 years in web applications projects üíª
- I published scientific papers in national and international conferences in Software Engineering üìã
- I adopted a cute shelter dog: Lady üêï

#### Shaolim - The Bot

Or maybe you are a professor and look for a way to engage your students. Yeah, I know! Some times it's a tough task, right? Maybe you could get some ideas from my project **Shaolim**, its a discord bot that help students find recorded classes (or other learning resources).
